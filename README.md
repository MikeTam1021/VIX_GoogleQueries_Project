# VIX_GoogleQueries_Project
Mike Tamillow, David Matsumura Data Science project ChiPy

This was our final presentation at the ChiPy meeting January 14th, 2016.

It is a project centered around attempting to use Google Domestic trends to predict the VIX.

Although Google has not updated their data since August 29th, 2015 
the code is written in such a way so that when google updates their data
the algorithm will naturally produce more up to date results, which should
correspond to a better linear model.

The files contained in here include the seperate parts of the program as well as a
complete notebook with explanations of what is happening.

Also to be included will be a web server displaying the pridiction from this model
and the slide show of the presentation.
